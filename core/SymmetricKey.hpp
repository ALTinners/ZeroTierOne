	 * The least significant bits are random. Key life time is limited to 2^31 messages
	 * per key as per the AES-GMAC-SIV spec, and this is a SIV mode anyway so nonce repetition
	 * is non-catastrophic.
	 * 
	 * The masking of the most significant bit is because we bisect the nonce space by
	 * which direction the message is going. If the sender's ZeroTier address is
	 * numerically greater than the receiver, this bit is flipped. This means that
	 * two sides of a conversation that have created their key instances at the same
	 * time are much less likely to duplicate nonces when sending pacekts from either
	 * end.
